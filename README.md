### Build instructions

```
1.Open this folder directory
2.Run npm install in hello-react-native. This should download and create the directories for the project.
3.Run npm run start to start the server to deliver the bundle url. Make sure this is running before you start your application.

4.Also you can open your Android or Ios device emulator and you can write react-native run-android instead of writing npm start
```
